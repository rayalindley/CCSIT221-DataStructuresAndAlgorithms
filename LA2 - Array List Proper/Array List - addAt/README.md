# Array List - addAt

The List ADT has the following operations already implemented in class:

void add(int num): Inserts num into the list.
int get(int pos): Returns the integer in the *pos*th position.
int remove(int num): Removes the first occurrence of num from the list and returns the position to which it was found.
 
Your task is to implement the following operations:
- void addAt(int num, int pos)
    : Inserts num as the *pos*th position in the list. For this problem, assume that the value of pos will always be valid.
